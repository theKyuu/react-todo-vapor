## To run this app locally

After running npm install, there are two commands needed to run both the React app and the JSON-server.
`npm run start` will start the app on port 3000
`npm run serve` will start the mock API on port 8000

You should also be able to run `npm run dev` to launch both watchers at once, but I'm not sure how reliable it is on every machine :)
